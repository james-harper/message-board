> A pseudo-anonymous messageboard which uses emojis to categorise each board

This application was primarily made so that I could play around with some libraries
that had caught my interest. This is why it is very limited in features in its current state.
I'll probably add some more stuff later though.

The libraries were:
- [Vue Router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router)
- [Tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons)
- [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug)
- [Firebase](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk)
- [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji)
